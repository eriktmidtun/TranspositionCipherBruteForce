sense of unreality  This body of his was unreal  the whole world was  What s happened   he began   Why did I ask you to marry me  How did it  Did you ask me to marry you   she wondered  They faded far away from each other  and neither of them could remember what had been said   We sat upon the ground   he recollected   We sat upon the ground   she confirmed him  The recollection of sitting upon the ground  such as it was  seemed to unite them again  and they walked on in silence  their minds sometimes working with difficulty and sometimes ceasing to work  their eyes alone perceiving the things round them  Now he would attempt again to tell her his faults  and why he loved her  and she would describe what she had felt at this time or at that time  and together they would interpret her feeling  So beautiful was the sound of their voices that by degrees they scarcely listened to the words they framed  Long silences came between their words  which were no longer silences of struggle and confusion but refreshing silences  in which trivial thoughts moved easily  They began to speak naturally of ordinary things  of the flowers and the trees  how they grew there so red  like garden flowers at home  and there bent and crooked like the arm of a twisted old man  kQ
